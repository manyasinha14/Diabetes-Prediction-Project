# Diabetes-Prediction-Project
This project predicts the likelihood of diabetes using supervised machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model training using XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. Performance is evaluated using ROC-AUC, and ensemble blending is applied to improve accuracy.
